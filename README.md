# I Leveraged pretrained Variants of the Base-BERT model particularly, ClinicalBERT and TinyBERT for the EEG Report Classification

In my recommendation, while ClinicalBERT did amazing since it was already pretrained on medical and clincal data, it isn't optimized for deployment on low and constrained resource settings.
Thus, TinyBERT was used to particularly handle this wile yielding top accuracy.
